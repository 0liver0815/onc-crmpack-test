Version 0.0.23
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Introduced combination designs via new classes:
  ComboData, ComboLogistic

* Introduced GeneralModel class, from which then the class Model for single
  agent dose escalation derives. Another branch is currently the ComboLogistic
  model for multiple agent combinations. Similarly introduced GeneralData class,
  from which the class Data for single agent derives, separately from that is
  the subclass DataCombo.

* Fixed bug in mcmc function which led to error
  "all data elements must have as many rows as the sample size was"

* Reduced number of MCMC samples for dual-endpoint example in vignette to be
  able to plot the vignette


Version 0.0.22
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* simulate function has been fixed (specification of arguments)

* Dual-endpoint model-based design has been added.

* 3+3 design simulation is now possible, see ?ThreePlusThreeDesign

* Welcome message on attaching crmPack, i.e. when library("crmPack") is
  run

* crmPackUpgrade() function for easy upgrade of crmPack to the latest version

* Rule-based designs now can be specified with the class RuleDesign, while the
  model-based designs stay with the class Design. An even more special class is
  the DualDesign class, for dual-endpoint model-based designs. Corresponding
  classes GeneralSimulations, Simulations and DualSimulations capture the output
  of the trial simulations for rule-based, model-based and dual-endpoint
  designs.

* The class Simulations-summary has been renamed to SimulationsSummary,
  similarly for the classes GeneralSimulationsSummary and
  DualSimulationsSummary.

* All Stopping and CohortSize rules that are based on intervals
  (IncrementsRelative, IncrementsRelativeDLT, CohortSizeRange, CohortSizeDLT)
  now use a different intervals definition. Now the "intervals" slots only contain
  the left bounds of the intervals. Before, the last element needed to be
  infinity. See the vignette for examples.

* StoppingMaxPatients class has been removed, as it was redundant with the class
  StoppingMinPatients. Please just use the StoppingMinPatients class instead.

* Initialization methods have been replaced by dedicated initialization
  functions. Please now use these Class(...) functions instead of new("Class",
  ...) calls to obtain the correct objects. This change is also reflected in the
  vignette.

* The extract function for extracting parameter samples from Samples objects has
  been removed (due to a name conflict with ggmcmc dependency packages). Please
  now use instead the "get" method for Samples objects (see the vignette for an
  example) to obtain data in the ggmcmc format.

* crmPack now needs the package httr (it's now in the "Imports" field). Packages
  Rcpp and RcppArmadillo have been moved from "Depends" to "Suggests" packages.
  Currently we are not using them at all.

* showLegend argument for model fit plotting functions, in order to show the
  legend or not.
