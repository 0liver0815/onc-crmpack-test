Version 0.1.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Bugfix: Previously, it could happen with NextBestNCRM rule, that higher doses
  lead to decreasing probability of overdosing, only because for some doses
  there was numerically probability 1 of having a DLT. With this bugfix, it was
  clarified in the rules documentation and fixed in the rule method, that the
  right limit of the overdose interval vector will be inclusive.

Version 0.1.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added examine function to generate a table of hypothetical trial courses
  for model-based and rule-based DLT-endpoint designs

* Made results from mcmc() (works with the usual set.seed in earlier user code)
  and simulate() (as previously already promised) reproducible. See help file
  for mcmc for more details. Additional improvements to reduce confusing warning
  messages / notes from mcmc() and higher-level functions.

* Made simulate with parallel=TRUE work on r.roche.com (Linux server),
  using the same parallelization method as for laptops (Windows)

* Passing an empty (zero length) vector as the doselimit parameter of the
  nextBest function is now considered as requesting a dose recommendation
  without a strict dose limit, and a corresponding warning is printed.

* Introduced GeneralModel class, from which then the class Model for single
  agent dose escalation derives. Another branch will be the ComboLogistic model
  for multiple agent combinations (in a future version). Similarly introduced
  GeneralData class, from which the class Data for single agent derives,
  separately from that will be the subclass DataCombo (in a future version).

Version 0.0.23
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fixed bug in mcmc function which led to error
  "all data elements must have as many rows as the sample size was" and slightly
  changed JAGS way of handling burnin / thinning (which should not have a user
  impact).

* Reduced number of MCMC samples for dual-endpoint example in vignette to be
  able to plot the vignette

Version 0.0.22
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* simulate function has been fixed (specification of arguments)

* Dual-endpoint model-based design has been added.

* 3+3 design simulation is now possible, see ?ThreePlusThreeDesign

* Welcome message on attaching crmPack, i.e. when library("crmPack") is
  run

* crmPackUpgrade() function for easy upgrade of crmPack to the latest version

* Rule-based designs now can be specified with the class RuleDesign, while the
  model-based designs stay with the class Design. An even more special class is
  the DualDesign class, for dual-endpoint model-based designs. Corresponding
  classes GeneralSimulations, Simulations and DualSimulations capture the output
  of the trial simulations for rule-based, model-based and dual-endpoint
  designs.

* The class Simulations-summary has been renamed to SimulationsSummary,
  similarly for the classes GeneralSimulationsSummary and
  DualSimulationsSummary.

* All Stopping and CohortSize rules that are based on intervals
  (IncrementsRelative, IncrementsRelativeDLT, CohortSizeRange, CohortSizeDLT)
  now use a different intervals definition. Now the "intervals" slots only contain
  the left bounds of the intervals. Before, the last element needed to be
  infinity. See the vignette for examples.

* StoppingMaxPatients class has been removed, as it was redundant with the class
  StoppingMinPatients. Please just use the StoppingMinPatients class instead.

* Initialization methods have been replaced by dedicated initialization
  functions. Please now use these Class(...) functions instead of new("Class",
  ...) calls to obtain the correct objects. This change is also reflected in the
  vignette.

* The extract function for extracting parameter samples from Samples objects has
  been removed (due to a name conflict with ggmcmc dependency packages). Please
  now use instead the "get" method for Samples objects (see the vignette for an
  example) to obtain data in the ggmcmc format.

* crmPack now needs the package httr (it's now in the "Imports" field). Packages
  Rcpp and RcppArmadillo have been moved from "Depends" to "Suggests" packages.
  Currently we are not using them at all.

* showLegend argument for model fit plotting functions, in order to show the
  legend or not.
