## Review

This paper describes the crmPack package for Model-based Dose Escalation. It is well-written, it is relevant, and it is novel. I was not previously aware of it, but I have begun using it after receiving the draft.

I have only a few, minor corrections:

- Please rewrite the two sentence in the abstract beginning with "By providing a simple..." They are wordy and confusing. I'm having trouble parsing them.
- Please rewrite the first sentence in the introduction. It is also long and confusing.
- Page 8. The description in "Adaptive stopping of the trial" is confusing. The trial stops as soon as myStopping1 is true or either myStopping2 or myStopping3 is reached. The code is clearer than the description.
