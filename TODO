BUGFIXES:

- examine function:
  Is that correct that also the check to see 'if there is no improvement in dose
  over the last cohort' should be added
  (Giuseppe's email) --> no, instead count number of times the same dose is 
  recommended contiguously and break after e.g. default 10000 times (can be option
  in examine function) to avoid infinite loop and issue a corresponding warning
  if this condition is met.
  
- remove RW2 warnings - it seems to work nicely now.

----------------------------------------------------------------
IMPROVEMENTS:

-   not use "Depends" in DESCRIPTION, as it can cause name clashes, and poor interaction with other packages. Use "Imports" instead.
- omit "Date" in DESCRIPTION. It is not required and it gets invalid quite often. A build date will     be added to the package when you perform `R CMD build` on it.
- add a "URL" field to DESCRIPTION. It helps users find information about your package online. If your package does not have a homepage, add an URL to GitHub, or the CRAN package page.
- Add a "BugReports" field to DESCRIPTION, and point it to a bug tracker. Many online code hosting
    services provide bug trackers for free, https://github.com, https://gitlab.com, etc.

- should the examine function also stop when the stopping rules are
fulfilled?

- include option to specify how many cores should be used when parallel=TRUE is used 

- add warning if the MinimalInformative prior or similar return a prior variance
  that is very low (to prevent undeliberately strong priors!)

- add a customized simulation summary function for the dual endpoint models,
  which also reports the frequency of simulated trials selecting the correct OBD

- include the submitted JSS manuscript as additional vignette in the package

- also optimize refDose for quantile->logistic functions

- make sure that it is clear in the documentation that the log transformation
  only applies to the slope (beta) and not to the intercept (alpha)
  
- the minimalInformative function should already produce a graph comparing the
  required and the resulting quantiles, instead of the user having to do it.

- record number of times the model is overruled in the simulations (Uli Beyer
request)

- mixture prior: add documentation in vignette

- allow different x values (doses) to be specified in simulate() to be passed to fit()

- remove WinBUGS since not really used anyway

----------------------------------------------------------------
NEW FEATURES:

- add slide production with ReporteRs package examples (to demo folder?)

- be able to run simulations on a cluster: use the BatchJobs package that is installed
  on the new Roche HPC - potentially as different fork of the package??

- production of Word output tables from simulation summaries

- minimal informative prior construction for other model(s), especially the probit model
  to allow construction for the dual endpoint models.

- other prior in the Kadane model -> how?

- historical data prior,
  pseudodata prior
