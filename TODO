BUGFIXES:

- make it possible to sample from prior for DualEndpointRW model,
  see report by Giuseppe in devel/dualEndpointRWbug.R
  
- resolve strange behavior of dual endpoint models when using placebo doses
  (Winnie's email)
  
- examine function:
  Is that correct that also the check to see 'if there is no improvement in dose
  over the last cohort' should be added
  (Giuseppe's email) --> no, instead count number of times the same dose is 
  recommended contiguously and break after e.g. default 10000 times (can be option
  in examine function) to avoid infinite loop and issue a corresponding warning
  if this condition is met.
  
- cohort size of 0 for placebo should work in the simulations
  (see Charles' email)
  

----------------------------------------------------------------
IMPROVEMENTS:

- include the submitted JSS manuscript as additional vignette in the package

- also optimize refDose for quantile->logistic functions

- make sure that it is clear in the documentation that the log transformation
  only applies to the slope (beta) and not to the intercept (alpha)
  
- the minimalInformative function should already produce a graph comparing the
  required and the resulting quantiles, instead of the user having to do it.

- record number of times the model is overruled in the simulations (Uli Beyer
request)

- mixture prior: add documentation in vignette

- allow different x values (doses) to be specified in simulate() to be passed to fit()

----------------------------------------------------------------
NEW FEATURES:

- add slide production with ReporteRs package examples (to demo folder?)

- be able to run simulations on a cluster

- production of Word output tables from simulation summaries

- minimal informative prior construction for other model(s)

- other prior in the Kadane model -> how?

- historical data prior,
  pseudodata prior
