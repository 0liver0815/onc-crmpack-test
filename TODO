ROLLING CRM:

- issue a warning if t0=0 in DataDA?

- Using an informative Gamma prior for lambda did not produce stable results. 
  How could this be done? would need proper documentation in help files/vignette
  
- C_par needs better documentation and potentially a change of name

- write a vignette (in Rmd format?) for rolling CRM, to make it easier
  to start with this kind of design
  
- Convert TITE CRM demo file to vignette in Rmd format (same as for rolling CRM
  demo). Reason is that vignettes are routinely checked and easier to find
  than demos.


----------------------------------------------------------------
BUGFIXES:

none


----------------------------------------------------------------
IMPROVEMENTS:

- add warning if the MinimalInformative prior or similar return a prior variance
  that is very low (to prevent undeliberately strong priors!)

- add a customized simulation summary function for the dual endpoint models,
  which also reports the frequency of simulated trials selecting the correct OBD

- also optimize refDose for quantile->logistic functions

- make sure that it is clear in the documentation that the log transformation
  only applies to the slope (beta) and not to the intercept (alpha)
  
- the minimalInformative function should already produce a graph comparing the
  required and the resulting quantiles, instead of the user having to do it.

- record number of times the model is overruled in the simulations (Uli Beyer
request)

- mixture prior: add documentation in vignette

- allow different x values (doses) to be specified in simulate() to be passed to fit()

----------------------------------------------------------------
NEW FEATURES:

- add slide production with ReporteRs package examples (to demo folder?)

- be able to run simulations on a cluster: use the BatchJobs package that is installed
  on the new Roche HPC - potentially as different fork of the package??

- production of Word output tables from simulation summaries

- minimal informative prior construction for other model(s), especially the probit model
  to allow construction for the dual endpoint models.

- other prior in the Kadane model -> how?

- historical data prior,
  pseudodata prior
