- add slide production with ReporteRs package examples (to demo folder?)

- mixture prior: add documentation in vignette

- be able to run simulations on the pRED cluster (with JAGS)

- combination designs

- allow placebos in the cohorts for CNS

- add examples to help pages

- production of Word output tables from simulation summaries

- minimal informative prior construction for other model(s)

- other prior in the Kadane model -> how?

- historical data prior,
  pseudodata prior

- record number of times the model is overruled in the simulations (Uli Beyer
request)

- implement one-parameter CRM with skeleton probabilities?
  -> perhaps also with random effects per doses (proposed by David)
