BUGFIXES:

- make it possible to sample from prior for DualEndpointRW model,
  see report by Giuseppe in devel/dualEndpointRWbug.R
  
- merge in fixes from the Stash / Daniel's local branch.

- why do new stopping rules for dual endpoint models not work with "and"/"or"
  operators?

----------------------------------------------------------------
IMPROVEMENTS:

- also optimize refDose for quantile->logistic functions

- make sure that it is clear in the documentation that the log transformation
  only applies to the slope (beta) and not to the intercept (alpha)
  
- the minimalInformative function should already produce a graph comparing the
  required and the resulting quantiles, instead of the user having to do it.

- record number of times the model is overruled in the simulations (Uli Beyer
request)

- mixture prior: add documentation in vignette

- allow different x values (doses) to be specified in simulate() to be passed to fit()

----------------------------------------------------------------
NEW FEATURES:

- add slide production with ReporteRs package examples (to demo folder?)

- be able to run simulations on a cluster

- allow placebos in the cohorts for CNS

- production of Word output tables from simulation summaries

- minimal informative prior construction for other model(s)

- other prior in the Kadane model -> how?

- historical data prior,
  pseudodata prior

- implement one-parameter CRM with skeleton probabilities?
  -> perhaps also with random effects per doses (proposed by David)
