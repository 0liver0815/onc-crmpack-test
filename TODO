BUGFIXES:

- make it possible to sample from prior for DualEndpointRW model,
  see report by Giuseppe in devel/dualEndpointRWbug.R

- check for accuracy of quantile outputs in quantile2LogisticNormal functions
  (Kaspar example)

----------------------------------------------------------------
IMPROVEMENTS:

- also optimize refDose for quantile->logistic functions

- record number of times the model is overruled in the simulations (Uli Beyer
request)

- add examples to help pages

- mixture prior: add documentation in vignette

- document alpha0 and alpha1 in the package vignette and help files (Kaspar)

alpha0 is the log-odds for a DLT at the reference dose x*. Therefore, the prior
mean for alpha0 is the expected log-odds at the reference dose x* before
observing any data. Note that the expected odds is not just the exp of the prior
mean of alpha0, because the non-linearity of the exp transformation. The
log-normal distribution on Wikipedia gives the formula for computing the prior
mean of exp(alpha0). alpha0 is the log(alpha) in the Neuenschwander et al.
(2008) paper. alpha1 equals the beta in the Neuenschwander et al paper.
exp(alpha1) gives the odds-ratio for DLT between two doses that differ by the
factor exp(1) ~ 2.7 alpha1 has a log-normal distribution in the
LogisticLogNormal model in order to ensure positivity of alpha1 and thus
exp(alpha1) > 1.

---------------------------------------------------------------- NEW FEATURES:

- add slide production with ReporteRs package examples (to demo folder?)

- be able to run simulations on the pRED cluster (with JAGS)

- allow placebos in the cohorts for CNS

- production of Word output tables from simulation summaries

- minimal informative prior construction for other model(s)

- other prior in the Kadane model -> how?

- historical data prior,
  pseudodata prior

- implement one-parameter CRM with skeleton probabilities?
  -> perhaps also with random effects per doses (proposed by David)
