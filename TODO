- combination designs

- allow placebos in the cohorts for CNS

- implement one-parameter CRM with skeleton probabilities?
  -> perhaps also with random effects per doses (proposed by David)

- test if custom MCMC sampler could be used for speed

- use faster sampler ... RStan perhaps?

- add examples to help pages

- be able to run simulations on the pRED cluster

- production of Word output tables from simulation summaries

- minimal informative prior construction for other model(s)

- other prior in the Kadane model -> how?

- historical data prior,
  pseudodata prior

- mixture prior

- record number of times the model is overruled in the simulations (Uli Beyer 
request)
