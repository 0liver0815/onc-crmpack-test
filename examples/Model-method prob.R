## obtain the probability of the occurrence of a DLE for a given dose level using a DLE model and a DLE sample
## DLE model can be models from 'Model' or 'ModelTox' class
## DLE samples is from 'Samples' class
## Given dose level 50 mg, to obtain the probability of the occurrence of DLE at this dose level
prob(dose=50, model=model, samples=samples)
