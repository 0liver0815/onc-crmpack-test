# As example, here we are combining 2 different increment rules. 

# The first rule is the following: 
#      maximum doubling the dose if no DLTs were observed at the current dose
#      or maximum increasing the dose by 1.33 if 1 or 2 DLTs were observed at the current dose
#      or maximum increasing the dose by 1.22 if 3 or more DLTs were observed

# The second rule is the following: 
#   maximum doubling the dose if the current dose is <20
#   OR only maximum increasing the dose by 1.33 if the current dose is >=20
