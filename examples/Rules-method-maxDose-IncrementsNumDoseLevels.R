# In this first example we define a rule for dose increments which would allow:
# Maximum skip one dose level, that is 2 dose levels higher than the last dose
# given. Maximum increment is explicitly defined as:
increments <- IncrementsNumDoseLevels(maxLevels = 2, basisLevel = "last")
# Since the default method is based on the last dose given, maximum increment
# can also be defined as:
increments <- IncrementsNumDoseLevels(maxLevels = 2)

# Based on the rule above, we then calculate the maximum dose allowed
max_dose <- maxDose(increments, data = data)

# In this second example we define a rule for dose increments which would allow:
# Maximum skip one dose level, that is 2 dose levels higher than the max dose
# given. Maximum increment is explicitly defined as:
increments <- IncrementsNumDoseLevels(maxLevels = 2, basisLevel = "max")

# Based on the rule above, we then calculate the maximum dose allowed
max_dose <- maxDose(increments, data = data)
