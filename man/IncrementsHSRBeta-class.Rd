\code{\link{IncrementsHSRBeta}} is a class for limiting further increments using
a Hard Safety Rule based on the Bin-Beta model.
Increment control is based on the number of observed DLTs and number of
subjects at each dose level. The probability of toxicity is calculated
using a Bin-Beta model with prior (a,b). If the probability exceeds
the threshold for a given dose, that dose and all doses above are excluded
from further escalation.
This is a hard safety rule that limits further escalation based on the
observed data per dose level, independent from the underlying model.
