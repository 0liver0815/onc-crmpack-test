\title{Standard logistic model with bivariate (log) normal prior with substractive
dose standardization}
\description{
This is the usual logistic regression model with a
bivariate normal prior on the intercept and log slope.
}
\details{
The covariate is the dose \eqn{x} minus the reference dose
\eqn{x^{*}}:

\deqn{logit[p(x)] = \alpha + \beta \cdot (x - x^{*})} where
\eqn{p(x)} is the probability of observing a DLT for a
given dose \eqn{x}.

The prior is \deqn{(\alpha, \log(\beta)) \sim Normal(\mu,
\Sigma)}

The slots of this class contain the mean vector and the
covariance matrix of the bivariate normal distribution, as
well as the reference dose.
