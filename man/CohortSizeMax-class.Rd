\title{Size based on maximum of multiple cohort size rules}
\description{
This class can be used to combine multiple cohort size rules with the MAX
operation.
}
\details{
\code{cohortSizeList} contains all cohort size rules, which are again
objects of class \code{\linkS4class{CohortSize}}. The maximum of these
individual cohort sizes is taken to give the final cohort size.

# Rule for having cohort of size 1 for doses <30
