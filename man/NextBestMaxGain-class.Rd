\title{This is a class for which to find the next dose which is safe and give the maximum gain value
for allocation. This is a class where no DLE and efficacy samples are involved. This is only based
on the probabilities of the occurrence of a DLE and the values of the mean efficacy responses
obtained by using the modal estimates of the DLE and efficacy model parameters.
There are two inputs which are the two target
probabilities of the occurrence of a DLE used during trial
and used at the end of trial, for finding the next best dose that is safe and gives the maximum
gain value and the dose to recommend at the end of a trial. This is only suitable to use with DLE models
specified in 'ModelTox' class and efficacy models  specified in 'ModelEff' (except 'EffFlexi' model)
class}

\item{\code{DLEDuringTrialtarget}}{the target probability of the occurrrence of a DLE to be used
during the trial}

\item{\code{DLEEndOfTrialtarget}}{the target probability of the occurrence of a DLE to be used at the end

probability of the occurrence of a DLE is equal to this target}

\examples{
##define the NextBestMaxGain class (no samples and based a pseudo DLE model and a efficacy model)
##specified the target probability of the occurrence of a DLE during the trial be 0.35
##specified the target probability of the occurrence of a DLE at the end of trial be 0.3

myNextBest <-NextBestMaxGain(DLEDuringTrialtarget=0.35,
