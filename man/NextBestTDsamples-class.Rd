\title{The class is to find the next best dose for allocation and the dose for final recommendation
at the end of a trial. There are two input target probabilities of the occurrence of a DLE
used during trial and used at the end of trial to find the two doses. For this class, only
DLE response will be incorporated for the dose allocation and DLEsamples
must be used to obtain the next dose for allocation.}

\describe{
\item{\code{targetDuringTrial}}{the target probability of the occurrrence of a DLE to be used
during the trial}

\item{\code{targetEndOfTrial}}{the target probability of the occurrence of a DLE to be used at the end
of the trial. This target is particularly used to recommend the dose at the end of a trial
for which its posterior
probability of the occurrence of a DLE is equal to this target}

\item{\code{derive}}{the function which derives from the input, a vector of the posterior samples called
 \code{TDsamples} of the dose
 which has the probability of the occurrence of DLE equals to either the targetDuringTrial or
 targetEndOfTrial, the final next best TDtargetDuringTrial (the dose with probability of the
 occurrence of DLE equals to the targetDuringTrial)and TDtargetEndOfTrial estimate.}

\examples{
##define the NextBestTDsamples class
##specified the target probability of the occurrence of a DLE during the trial be 0.35
##specified the target probability of the occurrence of a DLE at the end of trial be 0.3
## we want the use the 30\% posterior quantile (the 30th percentaile) of the TD35 (the dose 
## level with probability of DLE equals 0.35) and TD30 samples. A function is then defined 
## in the 'derive' slot
myNextBest <-NextBestTDsamples(targetDuringTrial=0.35,
                               targetEndOfTrial=0.3,
                               derive=function(TDsamples){quantile(TDsamples,probs=0.3)})
