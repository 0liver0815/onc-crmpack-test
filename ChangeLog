	* Remove the package's dependency on a (R2)WinBUGS installation.
	Include Word file with very detailed installation instructions.

2014-09-03  Daniel Sabanés Bové  <sabanesd@roche.com>

	* Add functionality for trial with two parts (SAD vs. MAD e.g.).

2014-07-13  Daniel Sabanés Bové  <sabanesd@roche.com>

	* Few more updates, including better simulation summary functions.

2014-07-01  Daniel Sabanés Bové  <sabanesd@roche.com>

	* Add StoppingMinPatients stopping rule.

2014-06-26  Daniel Sabanés Bové  <sabanesd@roche.com>

	* The LogisticNormal class was renamed to LogisticLogNormal, and a
	new LogisticNormal class was added which assumes a normal
	distribution for the slope parameter instead of a log normal. This
	new LogisticNormal class is now used for the quantile-based
	priors, and a fast sampler can be used for this standard GLM.

	* R/simulate.R: Compute the fit only at the end of one trial
	simulation, not after each cohort

2014-06-03  Daniel Sabanés Bové  <sabanesd@roche.com>

	* Now we use rcppbugs for the LogisticNormal model, which yields a
	two-fold speed-up compared to openBUGS. This is still not very
	fast though.

	* Added cohort size rules.

	* R/Rules-methods.R: If no dose on the dose grid has acceptable
	toxicity, then the NCRM and dual endpoint rules return NA as the
	recommended next best dose. Moreover, in that case the trial is
	stopped in any case. Note that during the actual run of the trial,
	the dose grid can be extended to lower doses in order to remedy
	this situation and to continue the trial at acceptable doses.

	* R/mcmc.R: Fixed an error that occurred when trying to sample
	with exactly one patient in the data. This is a workaround for a
	BRugs::bugsData feature (vectors with one entry only are not
	surrounded by c() in the BUGS data file, which BUGS doesn't
	allow).

2014-04-22  Daniel Sabanés Bové  <sabanesd@roche.com>

	* R/Simulations-methods.R: Only call arrangeGrob if there are
	multiple plots, otherwise return only the plot itself such that it
	can be modified later on.

2014-04-16  Daniel Sabanés Bové  <sabanesd@roche.com>

	* R/Data-methods.R: Better x-axis ticks for data plots.

2014-04-01  Daniel Sabanés Bové  <sabanesd@roche.com>

	* First version for testing.

2014-01-29  Daniel Sabanés Bové  <sabanesd@roche.com>

	* Started package.
