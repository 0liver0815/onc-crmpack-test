Description: Implements a wide range of model-based dose escalation
    designs, ranging from classical and modern continual reassessment
    methods (CRMs) based on dose-limiting toxicity endpoints to
    dual-endpoint designs taking into account a biomarker/efficacy
    outcome. The focus is on Bayesian inference, making it very easy to
    setup a new design with its own JAGS code. However, it is also
    possible to implement 3+3 designs for comparison or models with
    non-Bayesian estimation. The whole package is written in a modular
    form in the S4 class system, making it very flexible for adaptation to
    new models, escalation or stopping rules.
